Intiface is a set of applications and services for hosting sex toy connections. Where
[Buttplug](https://buttplug.io) is for developers, Intiface is for users.

Intiface Desktop acts as a main hub for managing devices on the system. At some point, it will also
work as a installer/launcher for Buttplug apps, dev toolkit, and who knows what else.

For those familiar with the development of [Buttplug](https://buttplug.io) so far, you may have seen
the "Buttplug Server" and other programs. Intiface takes the place of the Server program, and is the
basis of UI/UX for Buttplug on both desktop and mobile.
